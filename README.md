License: This is FREEWARE and you can modify it, put it in commercial software and do anything you like as long as you give credit where credit is due. I hope that this benefits the community in some way and feel free to improve on it as you wish, please just give credit to, Martin Sigley, for it's original creation.


IMPORTANT: This version is very much in beta form and is not very well tested, I have tested the routines only to a limited extent. DO NOT USE THIS WITH D64 IMAGES THAT YOU ONLY HAVE ONE COPY OF, you might regret it! 

If you should find errors please contact me at the email listed below.

Library Description: This library is intended to be used with Commodore D64 image files. It allows you to create blank images, load data, load directories, load the header, save data, save directories, save the header, manipulate the BAM (Block Allocation Map), copy files from one image to another as well as edit information on the disk image. 

This library has been written in both Microsoft Quick C 2.5 and Open Watcom 1.9 in both DOS 6.22 and Windows 95 operating system environments. I have never used it outside of these environments but I am pretty confident it will work well in pretty much any C environment you choose with little to no modification.
